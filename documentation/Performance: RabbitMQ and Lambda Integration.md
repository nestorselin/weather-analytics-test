# Performance: RabbitMQ Integration, AWS Lambda Integration

## Overview
This document proposes integrating RabbitMQ as a message broker into the Weather Analytics Platform to decouple processing, improve scalability, and optimize performance in weather data ingestion and alerting workflows.

## Why RabbitMQ??
RabbitMQ is a highly reliable and battle-tested message broker that provides:
v Asynchronous Task Execution — Offload heavy processes like weather fetching, DB writes, and alert generation.
- Scalability — Enables concurrent consumers to scale horizontally with minimal code change.
- Reliability — Supports delivery acknowledgments, retry logic, and dead-letter queues for fault tolerance.
- Decoupling — Separates logic between ingestion, alerting, and analytics modules via message-based communication.

## Expected Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**
   - Reduce latency for HTTP-triggered or cron-triggered operations
   - Decouple logic to avoid blocking long operations

2. **Horizontal Scalability**
   - RabbitMQ supports multiple consumers — can scale weather fetching and alert logic independently

3. **Modular Design**
   - Enables microservices or workers to evolve independently


## Overview
This document proposes offloading parts of the Weather Analytics Platform to AWS Lambda functions to reduce infrastructure overhead, enable near-infinite horizontal scalability, and optimize cost for infrequent but compute-intensive operations.

## Why AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying infrastructure. It’s well-suited for tasks that are:

- Event-driven or periodic

- Stateless

- Short-lived (under 15 minutes)

- Parallelizable by design (per city or region)

## Ideal for:
- Fetching weather data per city

- Performing on-demand analytics (daily summaries, trends)

- Processing alert evaluations in parallel

- Exporting data asynchronously (S3/CSV/BigQuery jobs)
